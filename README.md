ECU definitions for BMW E36 318i created by ba114

This is the development repository for identifying new maps in the Bosch M5.2.1 DME utilised in the E36 318i.
This repository will only be focussing on:

ECU: 0261203667

SW: 40


All contributions are welcome. Most maps are already known and i will periodically be adding more. The biggest help to this process would be anyone that is able to disassemble the code and identify the routine for EWS delete.
